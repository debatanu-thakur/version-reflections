How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Each line contained the content of the two files, and by checking them word by word, I was able
    to pin point the issue.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can go back to earlier versions and pick up code and re-use it and it opens up door for retaining
    and re-use old code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    A lot. One of the many things is when comparing the versions it is easy to track the changes.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    By typing git log in the command line, we get the log of each commit and we can scroll through them one by one.
    git diff we can see the difference in the commit files and see which lines were added or/and deleted.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It will make my work easier and smooth. By acheiving checkout of previous commits, I can
    make out where the bug was introduced.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To store my changes of websites I am going to build.
